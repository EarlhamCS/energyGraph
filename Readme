This is all the code neccessary to deploy the graph of Earlham's electrical energy
usage. The eDisplay directory should be mapped to be a <Location> in apache. The db
directory contains crontabs that should be installed, database defintions
that should be saved into postgres, and programs which query the energy monitoring
hardware.

Executing energy.sql as the energy user on new-proto will create the necessary schemas.
Running this command on proto.cs.earlham.edu will migrate all the data to new-proto: 
   pg_dump --data-only energy | bzip2 | ssh energy@test-proto "bunzip2 | psql energy
